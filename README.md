# 🤖 Machine Learning

Welcome to **Machine Learning** — a hands-on machine learning playground where I explore and implement core ML models in **Python, C++, and TensorFlow**, and recently started learning **PyTorch**. This repo documents my learning journey through practical implementations, not just theory.

## 📚 What's Inside?

A collection of Python scripts, Jupyter notebooks, and C++ programs covering:

### ✅ Core Models

- **Linear Regression** – Simple and multiple linear regression (Python & C++)  
- **Logistic Regression** – Binary classification from scratch, `scikit-learn`, and TensorFlow  
- **Multiclass Classification** – One-vs-rest, softmax-based classifiers (Python & TensorFlow)  
- **Neural Networks** – Fully connected networks with forward and backward propagation (C++ & TensorFlow)  
- **Cost Functions & Gradient Descent** – Custom implementations for full control  
- **PyTorch** – Started learning tensors and basic operations  

### 🔬 Practice Work

Experimentation with:

- Normalization & scaling  
- Train/test splits  
- Accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score  
- Decision boundaries visualization  
- Error analysis and optimizations

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Python** (NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, scikit-learn)  
- **C++** (OOP-based implementations, custom data handling)  
- **TensorFlow** (deep learning experiments, high-level API and flexibility)  
- **PyTorch** (currently learning tensors and basic operations)  
- **Jupyter Notebook**  

---

## 🎯 Learning Goals

- Reinforce theoretical understanding of ML models through code  
- Compare manual implementations (C++) with Python libraries and TensorFlow  
- Understand backpropagation, gradient descent, and GPU acceleration at a low level  
- Improve debugging, visualization, and model evaluation skills  
- Build intuition for when and how to use different models  

---

## 🧠 Status

This repo is a work-in-progress. Expect:

- Model tweaks and optimizations  
- More datasets and experiments  
- Comparisons between Python vs C++ vs TensorFlow implementations  
- PyTorch experiments starting with tensors  
- Newer algorithms soon (SVMs, Trees, advanced Neural Nets 👀)
